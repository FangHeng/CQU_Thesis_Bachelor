%ABSTRCT：Times New Roman 加粗三号，段前段后空一行

As a primary means of demonstrating research findings for undergraduate students, dissertation is a systematic and standardized record of the new inventions, theories or insights obtained by the author in the research work. It can not only function as an important reference when students pursue further studies, but also contribute to scientific research and social development.\par 
This template is therefore made to improve the quality of undergraduates’ dissertation and to further standardize it both in content and in format.
